## ðŸŽ« Self Ticket Machine ðŸŽ«
> A self-ticketing machine is a device that allows passengers to purchase train tickets without the need for assistance from a ticket agent. These machines are typically found at train stations and can be used by passengers to quickly and easily purchase tickets for their desired destination. Using a self-ticketing machine has several benefits. In addition to being convenient, it also allows passengers to avoid lines at the ticket counter and ensures that they can easily obtain a ticket before boarding the train.

## Description 
-  A self-ticketing machine for trains allows passengers to easily purchase tickets for their train journey without the need for assistance from staff. With this system, passengers can quickly and conveniently purchase tickets, reducing wait times and improving the overall experience of taking the train.

- In addition to the decsription previously described, the self-ticketing machine for trains also allows passengers to input their own money and receive change if the amount they pay is greater than the price of their ticket. This allows passengers to easily pay for their tickets without the need for exact change.

- The self-ticketing machine offers a selection of different train stations, and the price of each ticket varies depending on the distance of the selected station from the departure station. This allows passengers to easily choose their desired destination and see the cost of their ticket before making their purchase.

- Overall, the self-ticketing machine for trains offers a convenient and efficient solution for purchasing tickets, making the process of taking the train more streamlined and enjoyable for passengers.

## Features
The self-ticketing machine for trains offers a number of useful features to make the ticket purchasing process easy and convenient for passengers. Some of these features include :

- The ability to cancel a payment if the passenger changes their mind before completing their purchase.

- The ability to easily choose a station from a list of available destinations, with the option to see cost of each station.
